      <p>As a web developer if I will get a chance, I would like to use 
        my web development superpower to make a <b> Restaurant's Official Web Page</b>. 
        To create a  successful restaurant 
        website, you first pay a close attentionto the use of attractive layouts,
        clean font style, and an eye-catching color palette. Adding a picture gallery
        with rotating photographs of various food products to your website
        will make it even more appealing to visitors. You may also include relevant
        links on your website to assist your viewers in navigating across the site more effectively.</p>                                                                          <!-- p goes here --->
